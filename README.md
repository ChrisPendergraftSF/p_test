# Charting test,  total time 3:45min

# Request:
1. Create a Chart from A Jira Json of a 100 count board view.
2. Plot Developer on X-axis and developer track count on Y-axis. 
3. Add filters for Status, Track Type, and Priority, as stacked, additive filters.
4. Filters can be single or stacked. 
5. Create with any Charting lib, using react JS

# Challenges - 

1. Data was structured as a board, not grouped by developer.
2. Additive filters must be applied, on several fields.
3. A wrapper collection must be created with assingee and a collection of all tracks. 
4. Filters are ADD, not OR. So you can drill down
5. Y axis value is missing, so must be derived from dataset to get tracks-count (Y-axis)
6. X axis displays all devs found in result. 
7. The filters are decoupled from the view, via redux. 


# Application flow
1. App starts, loads initial data into application data as initial value of reducer. 
2. Filters, if not null are applied to data set. 
3. A copy collection, as a data wrapper, is called anytime there is a change in the selector modes(status, type, priority, or if they are nulled out )
4. Always maintains immutable collection we started with (JSON in store) 
5. No Need for redux-saga, no async calls to manage. Just react-redux. 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
